# Conway's Game of Life for the NES

This is a NES homebrew port of the classic cellular automaton, Conway's Game of Life, developed as a personal project to bring this fascinating game to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) platform.

> The project is a work in progress, and all development activities will be conducted in the [`development`](https://github.com/babasbot/conways-game-of-life-nes/tree/development) branch of this repository.

Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game takes place on an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The evolution of the grid is determined by a set of simple rules, creating mesmerizing patterns and behaviors.

This NES homebrew port aims to recreate the essence of Conway's Game of Life on the beloved NES console, allowing enthusiasts to enjoy the game on retro hardware.

## Game Rules

The game follows the standard rules of Conway's Game of Life:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

The game evolves step by step, and patterns emerge based on the initial configuration of live cells.
